In 2012, Beenzino released his first solo album, 24:26, and performed with Illionaire Records during their nationwide Korean tour that summer.[13] In November, he collaborated with label-mates The Quiett and Dok2 in the free digital single "Illionaire Gang", which was released to coincide with their November 11 Illionaire Day Concert.[14]

In 2013, the pre-release of his single "Dali, Van, Picasso" from his 2014 album Up All Night was downloaded almost 600,000 times without a music video, and propelled him to mainstream success.[5] He went on to perform at MU:Con 2013[15] and featured on albums by K.Will (The Third Album Part 2: Love Blossom) and Lee Hyori (Monochrome).[16]

In April 2014, he featured on the Junggigo song "Want U",[17] which was a number one hit in Korea and sold over a million copies.[18] He also performed at the 2014 Asian Music Festival on May 25 in New York City and the One Hip Hop Festival at Hongik University,[19][20] and as a featured guest during Verbal Jint's international concert tour.[21]

In 2016, he released his third album, 12, including the prior releases "Dali, Van, Picasso", "We Are Going To", and "Break".

In 2020, Beenzino left Illionaire Records and joined fellow rapper and friend E Sens after signing with Beasts and Natives Alike in 2021.[22]
