Can you briefly introduce "The First Metabus Hip Hop Concert"?

It is Korea's first metabus performance held at our Futurist Social Club (hereinafter referred to as FSC) gallery located on a small island called Vibes on the metabus platform called Cryptoboxel. Artists who are interested in my movements in the Korean hip-hop scene are willing to help me with this event. Metabus performances are different from commonly referred to as "non-face-to-face performances." I think the reason the audience is looking for a live show is to watch their favorite artist's performance, but the other half is to run around and play with people who know how to enjoy music similar to them. Metabus performances can satisfy that part to some extent.

Specifically, how is it different from general non-face-to-face performances?

In general non-face-to-face/untact performances, the role of the audience is reduced to the extent of chatting input,

<p style="margin-top:40px;">so it is difficult to erase the feeling of a wall between the performer and the viewer. However, in metabus performances, you can interact directly through avatars. Of course, there is nothing that can replace real live performances, but at least in the metabus, everyone can enter as avatars and enjoy the performance while feeling each other's energy at the same eye level. Rather, it is possible to interact in ways that are impossible in reality.

Why did you choose Cryptoboxel among many metabus platforms?</p>

I chose a platform called CryptoVoxel because of its wide accessibility. Unlike other platforms, CryptoVoxel does not require cumbersome procedures such as signing up or downloading apps if you know the address when accessing. If you enter "puturist.art" in the address window, you can visit our gallery anytime, anywhere.

What made you interested in blockchain technologies such as Metabus-centered movements and NFTs?

The first time I became interested in NFT was around the end of 2020. There was also an impact of limited external activities due to COVID-19, but I was able to detect a new future by seeing various art forms emerging through the concept of "digital authenticity." It was so nice to think that the role of intermediaries between artists and collectors was greatly reduced to the extent that they were justified, and that the rights and interests were directly returned to collectors and artists.

As I approached NFT technology from the perspective of art, I naturally began to step into Metabus. Since I have been a hardcore gamer since I was young, it was not difficult to adapt to the metabus environment. And it was assimilated into Crypto Ideology, which predicts an increasingly "decentralized future" by meeting interesting characters in the world. I came to think that communities created by people of the same ideology, transcending borders and public power, will create a future.
